This is a project done with the help of JsonPowerDB as backend. Only Roll No field is open and 3 buttons i.e save, update and reset and all other fields are disabled. 
If the user have already his record in database, he just need to enter his roll number in the Roll number field. Then all other fields are opened and save button is disabled where as reset and upate buttons aren't, so that the user can read and update his details. 
If the user is new then he cant enter Roll number then all other other fields are opened and save and reset are also opened but update button is still disabled as it is a new user, as soon as the user enter all the details and click on save , their record is created and saved in the database.
Reset button is helpful in clearing the form and pointing to roll number which is the primary key.
Main advantage of this is, there is no need to create database first unlike other databases. The first entry itself creates database automatically which reduces the work load of a developer.
